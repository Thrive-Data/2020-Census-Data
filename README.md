# 2020 American Community Survey PUMS Data 
This repository is for examining the viability of the 2020 American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) Census data for making comparisons in the trends of Opportunity Youth. The 2020 data suffered from sampling issues related to nonresponse of certain demographic groups which makes it difficult and, ultimately, ill-advised to make comparisons across years, see more information in [blog post](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2021/10/pandemic-impact-on-2020-acs-1-year-data.html) and [technical report](https://www.census.gov/library/working-papers/2021/acs/2021_CensusBureau_01.html). Given these data limitations, we must use extreme caution in investigating changes across populations, especially for small geographies like the city of Chicago.

The goal of this repository is to evaluate whether the 2020 ACS PUMS can be used to show changes in the Opportunity Youth (OY) population in the city of Chicago from 2019 to 2020. OY as youth ages 16-24 that are neither working (e.g. unemployed or not in the labor force) and not attending school. OY are a particularly vulnerable population and accurate data on there characteristics are important for allocating and coordinating resources.
